I am currently employed as a **Senior Software Engineer** [at Netflix](https://github.com/netflix). Throughout my professional journey in software development, which began in 2013, I've had the privilege of engaging with a wide array of technologies and software stacks. Over the years, I have accumulated experience across various stacks, frameworks, and programming languages.
